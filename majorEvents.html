		<h1 id="heading-title">Major Events in World War Two</h1>
		<p>This timeline of events in the Second World War show some of the most important events which helped contribute to the end result of the war (World War II Timeline, n.d.)</p>
		
		<h2>Before the War Starts</h2>
		<h3>July 1937: Japan Invades China</h3>
		<p>In July 1939, a Japanese-Chinese border incident led to war between the Empire of Japan and the Republic of China. They did not stop fighting until WWII ended.</p>
		
		<h2>The Start of the War</h2>
		<h3>September 1939: Germany Invades Poland</h3>
		<p>Nazi Germany invades Poland on September 1, 1939, starting the world war. Using &ldquo;Blitzkreig&rdquo; tactics, Germany was able to reach the Polish capital (Warsaw) within weeks, and forced them to surrender. Britain and France finally decided to declare war on Germany on  September 3, 2018, shortly after the invasion of Poland began. This commonly known as the beginning of the Second World War.</p>
		<h3>May-June 1940: Germany Invades France and Neighbouring Countries</h3>
		<p>On May 10, 1940, Germany starts an invasion of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg in preperation for the invasion of France. Again, using Blitzkrieg tactics, Germany invades France and is able to defeat them in a few weeks. France officially surrenders on June 22, 1940. After the French surrender, Britain stood alone against Germany and the Axis powers.</p>
		
		<h2>During the War</h2>
		<h3>June 1941: Operation Barbarossa</h3>
		<p>Germany launches Operation Barbarossa on June 22, invading the Soviet Union (USSR). This invasion violated the non-aggresion pact between the Soviet Union and Germany, which was signed in August 1939. The Soviet Union entered the war against Germany, joining the Allied powers. The invasion of the Soviet Union was one of the turning points in the war against Germany. The massive Red Army and the harsh Soviet winter eventually repelled the German offensive and turned the tide of the war.</p>
		<h3>December 1941: Attack on Pearl Harbour</h3>
		<p>Japan attacked Pearl Harbour in the US without any warning. The USA entered the war on the side of the Allies shortlty after this attack. This was a turning point in the war, as the USA could provide vast amount of resources for the allies.</p>
		
		<h2>Nearing the end of the War</h2>
		<h3>June 1944: D-Day</h3>
		<p>In June of 1944, Allied troops from Britain, the United States and Canada landed on the beaches of Normandy, France in what is now known as D-Day.</p>
		<h3>May 1945: Germany Surrenders</h3>
		<p>Germany surrenders to the Allies on May 7, 1945. By this time, the Soviets had captured Berlin and Germany was losing the war. This surrender ends the war in Europe.</p>
		<h3>September 1945: Japan Surrenders</h3>
		<p>Japan formally surrendered to the Allies on September 2, 1945. This surrender marked the end of the World War.</p>
